What is KNet
==============

Software Defined Networking(SDN) opens the innovation in networking domain. University Students/Research fellows does plenty of innovative networking solutions with SDN.

Building the Network Topology for their research activity is still nightmare.

KNet is Virtual Network Topology Builder, it builds the Network Topology as a real network environment.  It means the Nodes are built with Docker Containers.

User can install any required packages (apache2,mysql,hacking tools.. etc)
User have full control on the nodes to generate the real time original protocol traffic(no simulation).
